[Sedna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna) is a tiny, little dwarf planet in our Solar System, situated at 1.26Ã—10^10 km away from us. Likewise, SednaQube is a small [PocketQube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PocketQube) that hopes to be as small as Sedna is compared to other planets, and to work independently for as far away as Sedna is situated from us.

Another interesting aspect of Sedna is its orbit. This dwarf's orbital period is 11,408 years ([JPL](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=Sedna)). That's a lot of years! Similarly, SednaCube can record sensor data for multiple days on an SD card.
